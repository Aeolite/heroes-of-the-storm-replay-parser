# Heroes of the Storm Replay Parser

Web service that returns a JSON description of a *.StormReplay file from Blizzard's new game Heroes of the Storm

This code is built to be deployed to a Heroku instance, but can be run locally with foreman. See the [Heroku Getting Started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction) for more information.

This project is based on code from:
 * [S2Protocol](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2protocol)
 * [SC2Reader](http://sc2reader.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
 * [mpyq](https://github.com/eagleflo/mpyq)

Special thanks to Ben of [HOTS Logs](http://www.hotslogs.com) for helping me figure out the new GameEvents format!
